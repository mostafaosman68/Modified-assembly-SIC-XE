SIC/XE Assembler – Modified Version
This repository contains a modified version of the SIC/XE assembler, designed for educational purposes and enhanced with additional features for better performance and usability. The assembler processes SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer/Extended) assembly language, commonly used for teaching system programming concepts and low-level computer architecture.

📦 Features:
Enhanced Instruction Handling: Supports an expanded set of SIC/XE instructions and addressing modes.
Optimized Pass Structure: Improved two-pass assembler design for efficient object code generation.
Symbol Table Management: Better handling of symbol definitions and error detection for undefined symbols.
Error Reporting: Detailed error messages for common syntax and semantic issues in assembly code.
Extended Format Support: Proper support for extended format (+) instructions and indirect addressing.
User-Friendly Output: Generates object code and listing files in an easy-to-read format.
📁 Project Structure:
myAssembly/ – Core assembler source code.
code/ – Sample SIC/XE programs and test cases.
code2/ – Example SIC/XE programs for demonstration purposes.
Requirements:
Python compiler.
Basic understanding of SIC/XE architecture and assembly language.
🎯 Roadmap:
 Add support for macros and conditional assembly.
 Implement linking and relocation features.
 Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
