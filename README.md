# 🛠️ SIC/XE Assembler – Modified Version  

This repository contains a modified version of the **SIC/XE assembler**, designed for educational purposes and enhanced with additional features for better performance and usability. The assembler processes **SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer/Extended)** assembly language, commonly used for teaching system programming concepts and low-level computer architecture.

## 📦 Features
- ✅ **Enhanced Instruction Handling:** Supports an expanded set of SIC/XE instructions and addressing modes.  
- ✅ **Optimized Pass Structure:** Improved two-pass assembler design for efficient object code generation.  
- ✅ **Symbol Table Management:** Improved handling of symbol definitions and error detection for undefined symbols.  
- ✅ **Error Reporting:** Provides detailed error messages for syntax and semantic issues.  
- ✅ **Extended Format Support:** Proper support for extended format (`+`) instructions and indirect addressing.  
- ✅ **User-Friendly Output:** Generates object code and listing files in a clear, readable format.
